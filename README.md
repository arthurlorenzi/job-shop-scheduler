# Job Shop Scheduler

A simple implementation of the MAX-MIN Ant System in C++ to solve the classical job shop scheduling problem. Default parameters were found using irace (http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/irace/) R package.

Instances were obtained from OR-library (http://people.brunel.ac.uk/~mastjjb/jeb/orlib/files/jobshop1.txt)
